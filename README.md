A simple application that tracks your shows. In other words, it keeps track of what episode you need to watch next.

# Details
- It uses localStorage to persist data. Although you can always backup your data to a json file and restore it whenever you want.
- It depends on Omdb API.

## Notes
- Earliest version of pilot.
- I have rewritten the app in Svelte in a much cleaner way that allows it to scale in the future.
- Used **React**.
